# Arduino-Bluetooth-Basic
Simple Android application to control Arduino over Bluetooth. You need a Bluetooth Adapter for Arduino (tested with HC-06).

## Features
* **ON / OFF** - sends "1" and "0" to Arduino to turn LED on and off
* **RGB LED** - control analog RGB LED, messages like "255R" (sets red color to maximum) and "0G" (sets green color to minimum)
* **Terminal** - send any message you want to your Arduino
